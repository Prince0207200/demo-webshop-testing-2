## Prerequisites
‚úÖ This section lists the tools you need before running the project:

- Java JDK 8 or higher  
- Maven installed  
- Jenkins installed and running (tested on `localhost:8080`)  
- Selenium WebDriver dependencies configured  
- DemoWebshop application accessible  

---

## Setup Instructions

‚öôÔ∏è Follow these steps to set up the project locally or on Jenkins:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/demo-webshop-automation.git
    cd automation
    ```
    *Alternatively: You can manually import this project into Eclipse as a Maven project.*

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. **Configure Jenkins:**
    - Create a new Jenkins job (Freestyle or Pipeline)
    - Connect it to your GitHub repository
    - Set build triggers (e.g., GitHub webhook)
    - Add a build step to run tests:
      ```bash
      mvn test
      ```
    - Configure post-build actions to publish test reports

---

## How to Run

‚ñ∂Ô∏è You can run the test suite in two ways:

### Locally via Maven:
```bash
mvn test

```
    
- Via Jenkins(Recommended):
    - Trigger build manually or by commit webhook
    - Jenkins will execute tests and publish reports

---

## Known Issues & Resolutions
- Issue: Occasional test failure due to element timing delays  
- Resolution: Added explicit waits and retries to stabilize tests  

---

## Conclusion
The automation framework integrated with Jenkins ensures continuous testing of DemoWebshop, significantly reducing manual testing effort and providing fast feedback on code quality. This setup promotes efficient CI/CD practices and higher software reliability.
